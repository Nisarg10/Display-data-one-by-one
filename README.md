In this application, using Ruby language and mongoDB, data was fetched one by one and displayed on web page. One web page only 20 records are shown and it is replaced by the other data without refreshing the webpage.


○ What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?

    The easiest part was jquery because i didnot have to change much code from project 1.


○ What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

    The hardest I have to face was to ajax call to cross origin. Before using the this I did not now about this concept. Thus while 
    fetching data one by one it was not allowing access to it. Even trying different solutions didn't get the problem fix. At last chaged     to ajax call to controller.
    
    
○ If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest
concern?

    If I have to use ruby technologies professionally, my concern would be the ruby's differnt problems with Windows. Even I had problem     with Windows with previous projects.
